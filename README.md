# Blogify ðŸ“‘âœ¨
Welcome to Blogify, where words come to life and stories find their digital home! Blogify is more than just a blog app; it's a vibrant community of passionate writers, storytellers, and readers coming together to share, explore, and engage in the art of blogging.

## Overview

This repository contains essential information and guidelines for understanding and contributing to our project. Please read through this README to familiarize yourself with our Definitions Of Done (DoD) and find links to our frontend and backend repositories.

## Definitions Of Done (DoD)

The Definitions Of Done (DoD) for our project are aligned with the professor's requirements:

1. **Authentication & Authorization System:**
   - a) Visitors can access the blog without authentication.
   - b) Users must be logged in to publish an article.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - Implement a robust system for collecting and managing data.

3. **Recommendation System:**
   - Develop a recommendation system to enhance the user experience.

## Project Repositories
The project is divided in two parts :
- the backend repository : which uses the [Java](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-java-windows) [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/) framework and [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) with [POJA](https://github.com/hei-school/poja-cli).
- the frontend repository : coded with [React Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html) and uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/), [shadcn UI components](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) etc..

### Backend Repository

Our backend logic and API are housed in the following repository:

[Blogify API Repository](https://github.com/blogify-app/blogify-api)
#### How to use the app ?
The principle of POJA is that it deploys directly the application So you can check in the Github Actions and search for the deployed app link.

### Frontend Repository

The frontend, responsible for the user interface, is located in the following repository:

[Blogify Web Repository](https://github.com/blogify-app/blogify-web)
#### How to use the app ?
Those are the requirements : 
- Have a recent version of Node JS [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Get yarn [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)

All you have to do is :
- Clone the repository
- Install the packages with `yarn install`
- Run `yarn dev` if you want to see qht it looks like.
- Here are some commands you can use to execute some taska in our project :
```javascript
"scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "format:check": "prettier --check .",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "gen-cmp": "shadcn-ui add",
    "test:e2e": "cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/**/*",
    "test:unit": "cypress run --component",
    "test:open": "cypress open",
    "test:e2e:ci": "concurrently \"yarn dev\" \"yarn test:e2e\"",
    "test:ci": "test:unit && test:e2e:ci"
  },
```

However, you don't really need to do all of this to see what our app looks like, here is the link of the deployed app :
